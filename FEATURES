1. Everytime a user computes a linear algebra expression the server needs to
manipulate this linear algebra expression and show it to the friends of the
user. DONE

2. count the number of linear algebra expressions that users make and rank
users based on how many they have done. This will be done using redis.

3. Everytime a user gets a friend request send an email to the user notifying them of this. This will be done with RabbitMQ and celery, async. DONE

4. make recommendations of linear algebra expressions users should try based on past linear algebra expressions were computed; this will be done
with redis. DONE 

5. build a chat server

6. implement cache

~~~~~

In addition:
   - profile the server, try to determine the RPS and improve the RPS using
   memcache, memoization if possible

~~~~~

Learning outcomes:
	 - better understanding of django
	 - experience with redis, celery, async, memcache, rabbitmq, websockets; of course I need to understand the fundamantals behind all this :-)
